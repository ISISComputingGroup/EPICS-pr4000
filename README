INTRODUCTION
------------
This is the EPICS support module for the
MKS PR4000 Gauge Controller.

The PR4000 is able to drive two 628B gauges, each assigned to channels 1 or 2 of the controller.
The conroller utilises a RS232 interface for serial communications. The default framing is:

9600 baud
7 data bits
1 stop bits
Odd parity

The specification is based on MKS document:
PR 4000B-F  Edition 2010-11-23


USAGE
-----

Two templates are provided here:

1) pr4000.template
This instatiates all the records associated with the controller's common settings. i.e. not channel dependent.

2) pr4000chan.template
This instatiates all the records associated with a channel. There are two channels on the PR4000, so only two
instances will be required per controller.

example:

file pr4000.template
    {
    pattern { device               ,  port   }
            { ${domain}-VA-GCTLR-10, "ts1_18"}
    }
    
file pr4000chan.template
    {
    pattern { device               ,  port   , channel }
            { ${domain}-VA-GAUGE-01, "ts1_18", 1       }
            { ${domain}-VA-GAUGE-02, "ts1_18", 2       }
    }

    
The user interface is presently available via EDM screens. 
Starting with the root screen: 

pr4000.edl                : Summary of pressure, range and relay status for all channels.

pr4ksetupchannel.edl      : Configure channel setpoints and relay settings for each channel.

pr4ksetupcontroller.edl   : Controller ID and remote mode setting.
